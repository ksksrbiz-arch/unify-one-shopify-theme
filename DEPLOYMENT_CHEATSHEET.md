## 🎓 Advanced Git Commands

### Stash Changes Temporarily

```bash
# Save work in progress
git stash save "Newsletter form - incomplete"

# List all stashes
git stash list

# Restore latest stash
git stash pop

# Apply stash without removing it
git stash apply
```

**When to use:** Need to switch branches but not ready to commit.

### Cherry-pick Specific Commits

```bash
# Find commit hash
git log --oneline features/bug-fix

# Apply specific commit to current branch
git cherry-pick a1b2c3d

# Apply multiple commits
git cherry-pick commit1 commit2 commit3
```

**When to use:** Apply critical fix to production without merging entire feature.

### Keep Feature Branch Updated

```bash
# Rebase feature branch on develop
git checkout features/your-feature
git rebase develop

# Resolve conflicts (if any)
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Update PR
git push --force-with-lease origin features/your-feature
```

**When to use:** Sync feature branch with latest team changes.

### Recover Lost Work

```bash
# View all recent actions
git reflog

# Restore lost commit
git checkout abc123
# Or create branch from it
git branch recover-work abc123
```

**When to use:** Accidentally deleted commits or reset too far.

### Clean Up Commit History

```bash
# Interactive rebase last 5 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~5

# In editor: change 'pick' to 'squash' to combine commits
# Save and exit

# Update PR with clean history
git push --force-with-lease origin features/your-feature
```

**When to use:** Combine small commits before creating PR.
